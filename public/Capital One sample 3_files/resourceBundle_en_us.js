The Agreement applies in addition to, and does not replace, any other agreement that may apply in connection with your Capital One account(s), such as any Capital One consumer credit card, checking, savings and/or auto account(s) (each an &#8220;Account&#8221;).</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Before using the Bot, please read these Terms and Conditions, <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/identity-protection/privacy/statement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Capital One Privacy Policy</a>, and the <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/legal/terms-conditions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capital One Online Banking Terms and Conditions</a> (collectively, the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;).</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Your use of the Bot is conditioned on your acceptance of this Agreement. If you don&#8217;t accept these terms, you may not use the Bot.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Scope of the Bot: Your use of the Bot and related services that facilitate online banking via your phone or other eligible mobile device ("Capital One Software") is limited to the transactions provided for on the Capital One Online Banking website. Not all of our Online Banking website services will be available on the Bot. For example, you will not be able to make payments to our affiliated companies from deposit account(s) using the Bot.</p>\n<p><br />Privacy and Security: The Bot allows you to communicate with Capital One via text message regarding your Account(s). To use the Bot, you will have to exchange text messages with it. This means that information about your account, like transactions and balance, may stay in your text history. Any texts from your phone number will be treated by Capital One as a communication authorized by you, and any communication from Capital One in response to a request received from your phone will be treated by Capital One as a communication to you. In other words, you&#8217;re responsible for all of the interactions with Capital One via the Bot. For example, it&#8217;s possible that someone other than you could interact with Capital One via your phone, or that someone could view your text history (haters, maybe) and interactions. If you transmit sensitive information to/from the Bot, you agree to protect your phone using a passcode and/or another authentication device (e.g., fingerprint).</p>\n<p><br />ACH Debit Authorization: One of the things you may be able to do on the Bot is pay your Capital One credit card bill. You will be given choices about how much to pay (e.g., minimum payment or statement balance). By using the Bot, you authorize Capital One to initiate payments in amounts up to the greater of your credit limit of your credit card Account or your balance. The payment(s) will be initiated on the date(s) you direct the Bot to do so (&#8220;Payment Date&#8221;), but the timing of the withdrawal from your pay-from account (i.e., the checking or savings account that you use to pay down the bill) will be based on the pay-from account&#8217;s processing schedule. In other words, if you pay your Capital One bill from your Bank X checking account, we&#8217;ll start the process when you ask us to (and it usually takes less than two days), but we can&#8217;t promise how long it will take overall because it depends on the timing of Bank X debiting your account and sending it to us. Payments can be cancelled prior to the Payment Date by logging into your credit card Account on our website or by calling the number on the back of your Capital One credit card.</p>\n<p><br />Lost in Space: Sometimes text messages don&#8217;t get delivered, and even scientists don&#8217;t know why (though it&#8217;s often poor cell reception). We can&#8217;t guarantee that we&#8217;ll receive every text message you try to send us, or vice versa. So, if you&#8217;re trying to do something important (like pay your bill), do two things. First, make sure you receive a confirmation. Second, if you have any issues or doubts about the accuracy of your interactions with the Bot, you can still get your Account details all the same ways you were used to before you got fancy with newfangled technology (including using the Capital One mobile application(s) or logging on to your Account(s) on our website at <a href="http://www.capitalone.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.capitalone.com</a>). By accepting this Agreement, you understand and agree that Capital One is not responsible for inaccuracies in your interactions with Capital One via the Bot.</p>\n<p><br />Opting Out: The Bot sends two different types of messages &#8211; responses to your questions (e.g,, &#8220;What&#8217;s my balance,&#8221; &#8220;Recent Transactions&#8221;) and it may also text you other, unprompted messages (e.g., new features, reminders, updates, alerts).</p>\n<p><br />If you do not want to receive unprompted messages (e.g., new features, reminders, updates, alerts) from the Bot, text &#8220;STOP&#8221; to the Bot. The Bot will then only respond to your questions.</p>\n<p><br />If you do not want to receive any texts from the Bot, text &#8220;STOPALL&#8221; to the Bot. The Bot will then no longer respond to your questions. To use the Bot again, you will have to re-register.</p>\n<p><br />Pilot & Bugs: We&#8217;re making the Bot available as part of a limited, early pilot program. There may be bugs. In addition to the possibility of the Bot misunderstanding you, there&#8217;s also a possibility that something might not work correctly, or might not work at all. By getting this special preview and using the Bot, you&#8217;re accepting that risk. Again, you do not need the Bot to access to your Account(s). All of the information available from Capital One via the Bot is also available the old-fashioned ways. Don&#8217;t rely on the Bot as your sole means of accessing your Account(s).</p>\n<p><br />Contacting You: The purpose of the pilot is to give Capital One customers early access to test and provide feedback. We may seek your constructive feedback on the Bot, including problems you encounter, aspects that work well, and suggestions for improving it. You agree that Capital One may email you from time to time about your experience with the Bot.</p>\n<p><br />Electronic Records and Signatures: By accepting these terms, you consent to the general use of electronic records and signatures in our relationship with you.<br />Uptime and Longevity: We may change, suspend, or discontinue the Bot, or any part of it, at any time without notice. We, nor our agents, will be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to the Bot. Capital One may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain services related to Capital One Software, in any case and without notice or liability.&#160; Also, you should know that you do not need the Bot to access your Account(s). Don&#8217;t rely on it as your sole means of access. We will not be liable to you for any service interruptions or other unavailability of our Online Banking services.</p>\n<p><br />Termination/Future You: Your rights under this Agreement will automatically terminate without notice if you fail to comply with any of its terms. In case of such termination, we may immediately revoke your access to the Bot. Additionally, your rights may terminate if a duplicate version of you from the future time-travels BACK to our present time and proves that the fate of the world rests on your acceptance of this Agreement. Please note that versions of you from alternate timelines do not count and please stop asking.<br />Changes or Amendments: We may change, suspend, or discontinue the Bot, or any part of it, at any time without notice. We may amend any of this Agreement\'s terms at our sole discretion by posting the revised terms on our website at <a href="http://www.capitalone.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.capitalone.com</a>. Your continued use of the Bot after the effective date of the revised Agreement constitutes acceptance of the terms.</p>\n<p><br />Disclaimer of Warranty: Just in case this isn&#8217;t clear yet, you acknowledge and agree that all use of the Bot is at your sole risk. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR YOUR USE OF THE BOT, THAT IT IS PROVIDED &#8221;AS IS&#8221;, AND THAT CAPITAL ONE MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. CAPITAL ONE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM CAPITAL ONE, OR THROUGH OR FROM THE BOT, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.</p>\n<p><br />Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue: C&#8217;mon, let&#8217;s not fight about this. But if we do have to fight, we agree to do it in Virginia. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia without regard to any portion of its choice of law principles that might provide for application of a different jurisdiction\'s law; provided, however, that to the maximum extent permitted under applicable laws, this Agreement will not be subject to the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act as currently enacted or as may be codified or amended from time to time by any jurisdiction. You irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Courts for the Eastern District of Virginia, or if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, to the courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia located in Henrico County or Fairfax County.</p>'}}},core_global_footer_discl:{article:{section:{body:'<p><strong>Investment and Insurance Products: Are Not FDIC Insured &#8226; Are Not Bank Guaranteed &#8226; May Lose Value &#8226; Are Not a Deposit &#8226; Are Not Insured by Any Federal Government Agency</strong><br />Banking and lending products and services are offered by Capital One, N.A., and Capital One Bank (USA), N.A., Members FDIC.<br />Investment products are offered by Capital One Investing, LLC, a registered broker-dealer and Member <a href="http://www.finra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FINRA</a>/<a href="http://www.sipc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SIPC</a>.
